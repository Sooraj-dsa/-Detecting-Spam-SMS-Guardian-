# SMS Guardian üì¨‚úâÔ∏èü§ñ

## Overview
Detecting Spam and Ham in SMS messages using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project employs machine learning models to sift through messages and identify potential spam, ensuring your SMS inbox remains secure.

## Problem Statement
With the rise of spam messages, it becomes crucial to have a reliable system that can differentiate between genuine messages (ham) and unwanted spam. This project addresses this challenge by building a robust SMS classifier.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration and Feature Engineering
- **Dataset:** Explored a dataset containing 5,574 messages in English, classifying them as ham or spam.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features, identified outliers, and preprocessed data for effective modeling.

### 2. Text Data Cleaning
- **Punctuation and Numbers Removal:** Extracted alphabetic characters for cleaner text.
- **Lowercasing:** Ensured uniformity by converting all characters to lowercase.

### 3. Text Processing and Vectorization
- **Tokenization:** Broke down text into words for better analysis.
- **Stopword Removal:** Eliminated common and less informative words.
- **Lemmatization:** Simplified words to their base form.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converted processed text into numerical vectors.

### 4. Model Building
- **Model Pipeline:** Developed a comprehensive pipeline with Na√Øve Bayes, RandomForest, KNeighbors, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Cross-Validation:** Ensured model reliability through cross-validation on the training set, assessing accuracy and overall performance.
